me:
can you create a question of java oop related to soccer player?

mr gpt:
Sure! Here's an object-oriented programming (OOP) question related to a soccer player in Java:

Question:
Design a Java class hierarchy to represent soccer players. Implement the following:

A base class Player with:

Attributes: name, age, position (e.g., "Forward", "Midfielder", "Defender", "Goalkeeper").
A method displayInfo() that prints player details.
A subclass SoccerPlayer that extends Player and adds:

Attributes: goalsScored, assists.
A method updateStats(int goals, int assists) to update the player's statistics.
Create an instance of SoccerPlayer, set its attributes, update its stats, and display the playerâ€™s details.

Bonus Challenge:

Implement encapsulation by making attributes private and providing getters and setters.
Override the displayInfo() method in SoccerPlayer to include goals and assists.
